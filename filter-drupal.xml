<!--File to hold drupal connection info for the FilterDrupal servlet filter.  For multisite drupal installs you can include multiple connection elements.  We will query all the databases and assume any
    user in any drupal db with the same username and password are the same user.  We will gather all roles for that user from all databases.  This is a potential security risk if a user in one drupal db has the same username and password
    as another user in a seperate drupaldb (and is not the same user).  We are also assuming all drupal dbs to be mysql.  This file should be located in the same file as the fedora.cfcg file-->
